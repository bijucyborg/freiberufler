# Why this repo?

I started my life as freiberufler, freelancer, selbst채ndig, in June 2023 and have come across many resources since then.
I find myself constantly giving advice to other freelancers in Germany and hence thought of compiling all the info I have in a github repo, so that its easily discovered by others as well.

Feel free to contribute to this repo with resources you are aware of via a pull request and I will merge it if appropriate.

# Working with clients outside Germany within EUROPE

1. You might need a A1 Certificate if your client is outside of Germany. It was struggle for me to find the right way to order this certificate.
   One needs to access the SV Meldeportal https://app.sv-meldeportal.de/de/login, and click on the link which is at the very bottom of the page.
